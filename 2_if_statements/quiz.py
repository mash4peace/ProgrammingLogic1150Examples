answer = input('What is the capital of Wisconsin? ')  # It's Madison

if answer == 'Madison':
    print('Correct!')

# Problems with this program
# 1. The answer has to be in the same case as the answer in the program, so "sacramento" is wrong
# 2. The user doesn't see any message if they get the answer wrong
